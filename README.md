## Chessboard Game

This is a simple chessboard game written in JavaScript. The game is still under development, but it is playable.

### How to play

To play the game, simply click on a piece to move it. You can only move pieces to squares that are a valid move for that piece type. To capture an opponent's piece, simply move your piece to the square that the opponent's piece is occupying.

The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate occurs when the king is in check and there is no way to get it out of check.

### Installation and running

To install and run the game, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Dependencies

The game has no dependencies.

### Future development plans

I plan to add more features to the game in the future, such as:

* A multiplayer mode
* A computer opponent
* More chessboard themes
* More chess pieces
